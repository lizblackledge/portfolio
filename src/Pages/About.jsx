Oh, I'm so great and interesting. You really want me on your team! Oh, how I love computers! I have been coding since I was 7 and built my own computer when I was 12. Apart from coding, I enjoy learning about new cultures and languages. Kayaking and hiking are the best. I have studied a little martial arts in the past, and I want to get back into it soon.</Typography>
